# %*% Experiment metainfo and time synchronization server.
# %*% TODO: Document this a bit more.
#
# It receives 3 types of commands:
# * time:<float>  -> Tells the service the local time for the subprocess for sync reasons.
# * set:key:value -> Sets an arbitrary variable associated with this connection to the
#                    specified value, can be used to share arbitrary data generated at
#                    startup between nodes just before starting the experiment.
# * ready         -> Indicates that this specific instance has ending sending its info
#                    and its ready to start.
#
# When the all of the instances we are waiting for are all ready, all the information will
# be sent back to them in the form of a JSON document. After this, a "go" command will
# be sent to indicate that they should start running the experiment.
#
# Example of an expected exchange:
# [connection is opened by the client]
# -> time:1378479678.11
# -> set:asdf:ooooo
# -> ready
# <- id:0
# <- {"0": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "time_offset": -0.94, "port": 12000, "asdf": "ooooo"}, "1": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "time_offset": "-1378479680.61", "port": 12001, "asdf": "ooooo"}, "2": {"host": "127.0.0.1", "time_offset": "-1378479682.26", "port": 12002, "asdf": "ooooo"}}
# <- go
# [Connection is closed by the server]
