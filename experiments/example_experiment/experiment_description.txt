Example experiment for running the last n revisions in Git and doing something with them.
(configured in config.conf)


iterate_over_all_revs.sh:
1. Clones repository REPOSITORY if necessary.
2. Iterates over the revisions (FINAL_REVISION to INITIAL_REVISION)
	- performs TESTCOMMAND STAP_RUN_ITERATIONS times and logs the data using systemtap.
	
ingest_revision_runs.sh:
1. Iterates over CSV files in stap output directory
	- makes IO writes report
	- stores run in database
2. Regenerates all profiles for this testcase and stores these in the database.
